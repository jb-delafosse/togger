Currently ARM isn't supported, but feel free to use your own base image.

The repository also contains Procfile to run the app on heroku

## TODO
* add LDAP auth

## Very first steps

### Initial

1. Initialize `git` inside your repo:

```bash
git init
```

2. If you don't have `Poetry` installed run:

```bash
make download-poetry
```

3. Initialize poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
```

4. Upload initial code to GitHub (ensure you've run `make install` to use `pre-commit`):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jb-delafosse/togger.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Poetry

All manipulations with dependencies are executed through Poetry. If you're new to it, look through [the documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Notes about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry build`
- etc

## üìà Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jb-delafosse/togger/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

For Pull Request this labels are configured, by default:

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |
|:-------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| `enhancement`, `feature`              | üöÄ Features             |
| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | üîß Fixes & Refactoring  |
| `build`, `ci`, `testing`              | üì¶ Build System & CI/CD |
| `breaking`                            | üí• Breaking Changes     |
| `documentation`                       | üìù Documentation        |
| `dependencies`                        | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependencies updates |

You can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/jb-delafosse/togger/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml).

GitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.
